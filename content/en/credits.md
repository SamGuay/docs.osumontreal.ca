We appreciate all efforts that go into making tools, packages and libraries, and
documentation freely available to all. So here's a non-exhaustive list dedicated
to the ones we have used so far to build and support the Open Science UMontreal
community.

Thanks to them for making Open Science and Open Source Software better!
